# Seq2Seq-Pytorch-Modifications


### This project aims to understand a fascinating concept that is observed in Neural Machine Translation. It was observed that English to French translations were giving better results in a Seq2Seq model when the source sentences(English) were trained and fed to the network in reverse.
### We hypothesize that this happens because of the reduced proximity between verb phrases. 
### A direct result of this project would provide a simple trick to help improve translation systems by choosing whether to reverse either source sentences or target sentences or both during training.
